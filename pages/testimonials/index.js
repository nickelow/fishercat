          “I had the pleasure of working closely with Kyle to hire for multiple
          roles on my data analytics team at Fast Growing Trees. Kyle went above
          and beyond to deeply understand the expectations for the roles and
          types of candidates I was willing to consider. Kyle felt very much
          like a partner in the recruiting process, not only accommodating my
          stated asks regarding the screening process, but also suggesting
          specific ways to more effectively accomplish my recruiting goals. Kyle
          was able to screen a high volume of candidates for their
          qualifications, soft skills, and even baseline analytical prowess; I
          cannot recall a single instance where an obviously poor fit was able
          to make it through Kyle’s initial screening. I highly recommend Kyle
          to any team or organization looking to quickly recruit top-tier
          talent.“

          “Few things are more important to a business than the people they
          hire. Finding the right recruiting partners to work with hiring
          managers is critical to success. Kyle was an incredible partner that
          listened to our hiring team and took action. He advised on next steps
          and always showed up with valuable intel about the candidate that
          helped our hiring team better understand the candidate's potential.
          Our team trusted Kyle and he delivered on that trust every time. I
          highly recommend Kyle.“
