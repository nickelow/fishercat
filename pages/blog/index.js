          Throughout my career, I’ve been fortunate to work with a lot of
          incredible founders, leaders, and fellow recruiters. I’m grateful that
          I’ve had the opportunity to learn from such talented people, seeing
          firsthand how some of the best organizations have hired.

          Building and scaling a team, especially at an early stage startup, is
          unique. What works for some organizations may not work for others, and
          there’s a delicate balance between establishing enough processes to be
          efficient without overcomplicating things.

          I’ve been able to experience recruiting and teambuilding from
          different angles, which has given me a unique perspective on the
          process. From my time as a recruiter at an executive search agency, as
          an in-house recruiter supporting venture-backed startups, and also
          from the perspective of a venture capital firm where I helped
          portfolio companies hire and scale, one thing I’ve realized is that
          there’s no shortage of aspiring founders with great ideas, but the
          ability to assemble a high-performing team is a significant challenge.

          Recruiting and interviewing can be time-consuming and expensive. After
          hiring and placing hundreds of professionals and helping founders
          establish practical recruiting strategies, I realized that a scalable
          approach to recruiting and team-building was sorely needed in the
          industry.

          There is a unique opportunity to think through recruiting more
          holistically than ever before, simultaneously tackling both the
          recruiting strategy as well as executing on the tactical aspects of
          hiring. The best agency recruiters in the world can help companies
          hire great people, but it can be costly and may not be scalable. For
          many startups, it may not always be the right time to hire full-time
          recruiting support, and in-house recruiters are often stretched thin
          and may struggle to adjust to the high-paced demands of a startup.

          I’ve decided to found Fishercat Consulting to partner with emerging
          high-growth companies to establish a scalable approach to recruiting.
          Over the last year and a half, I’ve been lucky enough to support early
          stage organizations (typically seed to Series C) with their hiring and
          recruiting across their sales, engineering, product, and design teams,
          and I’m tremendously excited to publicly launch Fishercat Consulting.

          From the time I first encountered a fishercat on a hike in the woods
          near my childhood home, I’ve been fascinated by the animal. Despite
          their relatively small size (typically less than twenty pounds),
          they’ve been able to carve out their own place in the food chain,
          competing with larger predators like bears, bobcats, and mountain
          lions and hunting game like deer and porcupines. It’s a tenacious
          animal, and I thought that the name, “Fishercat Consulting,” reflected
          not only my New England roots, but also the classic startup dynamic of
          a lean, hungry up-and-comer competing with larger and more established
          companies.
